Dacets is a tool for scientists (pros and amateurs) to facilitate handling and
tracking of research data files, associated experimental metadata and random
notes: where the files came from, where they are stored, what's inside, to which
project they belong, etc. It should be useful for individual use as well as
for collaborations.

It is based on ideas of software package managment (deb, rpm, pip, npm,  etc)
and version control systems (git and mercurial). It is similar to dpm_, but with
greater focus on academic research data (physics, chemistry, biology, ...) and
capture of detailed experimental conditons.
